üéØ Prompt for Jekyll Project Optimization and Troubleshooting by an AI

Context:
I am developing a project in Jekyll and have identified some issues that require correction and optimization. I want the AI to perform a detailed analysis and propose specific improvements, providing clear solutions for each problem. Below are the key areas that need adjustments:

‚úÖ 1. Paginator is not working:
- Check the proper configuration of the paginator in the _config.yml file, including the paginate definition and assignment of a valid collection.
- Ensure that .md files are correctly organized in the expected folders (e.g., _posts).
- Review the loop implementation in template files (e.g., index.html, blog.html) to confirm proper iteration over the items.
- Validate if there are conflicts with plugins or Jekyll versions.

‚úÖ 2. Mobile and Low-Resolution Screen Optimization:
- Adjust the layout to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes without content overlap.
- Ensure that the Table of Contents (TOC) remains fixed and static, without shifting its position on smaller screens.
- Review media queries to fix undesirable behaviors on mobile devices and low-resolution screens.
- Implement techniques like viewport units (vw/vh), flexbox, and grid for better element distribution.

‚úÖ 3. Page Load Reordering Effect:
- Eliminate the Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC), ensuring styles are applied before rendering.
- Optimize asynchronous loading of CSS and JavaScript files.
- Add preload and font-display: swap for external fonts to prevent abrupt layout shifts.
- Identify and resolve render-blocking issues to enhance loading performance.

‚úÖ 4. Main Content Images without Links:
- Verify that all images in the main content are properly linked and accessible.
- Inspect relative paths and folder structures to prevent 404 errors.
- Implement lazy loading for images and optimize formats (e.g., WebP) to reduce load times.

üîç Additional Requirements:
1. Suggest SEO best practices for page optimization.
2. Indicate improvements for load time, such as CSS/JS minification and caching.
3. Propose accessibility adjustments (WCAG), including color contrast and keyboard navigation.
4. Identify hidden issues that might affect user experience or search engine indexing.
5. Check if Jekyll dependencies need updates and recommend modern deployment practices.

Objective:
The final result should be an optimized, fast, responsive, and accessible page across all devices, following SEO best practices and modern web development standards.
